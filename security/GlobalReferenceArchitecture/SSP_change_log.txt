== Changelog <1.2> ==

1.	In the Global Reference Architecture (GRA) Service Specification Package V 1.1.0 (Template) file metadata.xsd, in the definition for the element gra:ExchangePartnerTypes, the element in the sequence with ref="gra:ExchangePartnerTypeDescriptionText" should have the attribute maxOccurs="unbounded". This also applies to gra:Classifications/gra:Classification and gra:ApplicablePolicies/gra:PolicyText. These are all “collections” that should allow for multiple members in the collection.  Update completed.

2.	Also in the GRA Service Specification Package V 1.1.0 (Template) file metadata.xsd, the definition for gra:ServiceDescriptionKeywords has the child element gra:ServiceDependency as the only element in its sequence. Instead, it should have the child element gra:ServiceDescriptionKeywordText.  Update completed

4.	There is inconstancy in the use of underscores between words in folder names. In the template zip file, the folders “service_model” and “information_model” have underscores, but the others (including “behavior model”) do not.  Update completed.

5.	Changed the “readme.txt” file in the root to,  “This folder contains a service specification package template. Instructions on how to use this service specification package template can be found in the Service Specification Guideline Document available at http://www.it.ojp.gov/gra.”  Changed the URL to be:  http://it.ojp.gov/gist/43/The-Global-Reference-Architecture--GRA--Service-Specification-Guideline-V-1-1-0.
